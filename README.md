# MUSICVAULT

# Description
So for my final project I wanted to create something that I am passionate about, and since I play the drums and have my own band, I decided to create MUSICVAULT. The exclusive music store for musicians who no longer play can sell at a reasonable price just their musical instruments to other musicians or to give back to those less fortunate. My tag line says it all, "One Musician's Outgrowth Can be Someone Else's Beginning."
